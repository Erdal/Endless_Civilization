# Endless_Civilization
A game where you control a small pocket of humans at the dawn of civilization.
It is your duty to guide them through life and help humanity prosper, but be warned the gods are against you.
Your civilization will be wiped out periodically, you will be awarded power equivalent to your civilizations success under your guidance.
You can use your new found power to benefit your next tribe of humans, learn from your mistakes and prosper.
Will you continue to watch as all your efforts are lost with the whim of the gods, or will you rise and make even the gods bow before you.
